# How to create a Widget
In this repository I created a widget to better understand how to implement this framework.

This Idea is born from my MC3 project in which I would have needed an implementation like the one I developed in this Git repository.

To create this widget I used : 
- WidgetKit
- SwiftUI

This is my first result but of course I have to work again on it , because it could be improved.
